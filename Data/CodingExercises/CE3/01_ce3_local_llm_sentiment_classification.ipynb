        "# Coding Exercise 3: Local LLM Sentiment Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we'll use a small LLM _running on our own machine_ (well, on a Google Colab virtual machine...) to automatically classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a practical example of how businesses use AI today — instead of a human reading thousands of reviews, an LLM can do it in seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "It follows from **Episode 7**, where we looked at how LLMs work and the wealth of possible use cases. It also illustrates an area where LLMs can perform as well, if not better than traditional NLP-based sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we'll do:\n",
        "1. **Fetch reviews** from a URL using Python's `requests` library (simulating pulling data from an API)\n",
        "2. **Load a small LLM** called Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct onto our machine\n",
        "3. **Classify each review** by giving the model a carefully worded prompt\n",
        "4. **Review the results** and discuss what worked and what didn't\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note: From the Runtime menu above, select \"Change runtime type\" and then select \"T4 GPU\" for the hardware accelerator. This will run the model significantly faster than on the CPU runtime.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why a local model?\n",
        "Services like ChatGPT and Claude run on remote servers — you send your data to them over the internet. A **local model** runs right here on this computer. This matters when:\n",
        "- You're working with **sensitive data** (medical records, financial info) that can't leave your system\n",
        "- You want to avoid **API costs** (cloud AI services charge per request)\n",
        "- You need to work **offline** or with very low latency\n",
        "\n",
        "The trade-off: local models are typically much smaller and less capable than cloud models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this exercise, you should understand:\n",
        "1. How the `requests` Python library can be used to retrieve data from the web\n",
        "2. How to download a local model from Hugging Face\n",
        "3. How to load that model into PyTorch, along with its tokenizer\n",
        "4. How to write a classifier function we can use to classify each review\n",
        "5. How to clean and santise the model output\n",
        "6. How to summarise and sanity check results\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim here is to extend what we've learned about building and training models into actually using them to do stuff."

            "  [ 2] They make their own pasta in-house and you can watch them doing it. The tagliatelle was sublime.\n",
            "  [ 3] The salad was fresh enough and reasonably sized. Fairly priced too. Just not very exciting.\n",
            "  [ 4] I asked for no onions due to an allergy and my dish arrived loaded with onions. Dangerous.\n",
            "  [ 5] The vegan options consisted of a side salad. In 2024. Really.\n",
            "  [ 6] The panini was so tightly pressed it was basically a cracker with some cheese inside.\n",
            "  [ 7] The chef came out to check on our table personally. That kind of attention to detail is rare.\n",
            "  [ 8] Decent enough for a quick lunch. Standard fare at standard prices.\n",
            "  [ 9] We come here occasionally when everywhere else is full. It does what it needs to do.\n",
            "  [10] Sticky tables, dirty cutlery, and a general feeling that hygiene isn't a priority here.\n",
            "  [11] The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our dietary needs. Will definitely be back.\n",
            "  [12] A perfect neighbourhood restaurant. Reliable, welcoming, and the food always delivers.\n",
            "  [13] The tasting menu was a culinary journey. Every course was a surprise and a delight.\n",
            "  [14] The katsu curry was crispy, saucy, and deeply comforting. My new favourite comfort food.\n",
            "  [15] We split the bill evenly because everything was roughly the same quality — middling.\n",
            "  [16] I've been to every burger joint in the city and this one wins. It's not even close.\n",
            "  [17] The pizza base was like cardboard. Thin and crispy is one thing, dry and flavourless is another.\n",
            "  [18] The cocktail menu alone is worth the visit, but the tapas are equally impressive.\n",
            "  [19] The waiter was incredibly rude when we asked about allergens. Won't be returning.\n",
            "  [20] The pasta was so overcooked it was basically mush. My five-year-old could do better.\n",
            "  [21] The service was neither fast nor slow. The food was neither hot nor cold. Just very middle.\n",
            "  [22] The vegetarian options are excellent but the meat dishes are weirdly bland.\n",
            "  [23] The gnocchi was light as air. I don't know how they do it but it was extraordinary.\n",
            "  [24] The chocolate fondant was the best I've ever tasted. Perfectly gooey in the middle.\n",
            "  [25] The sauce on the pasta tasted like it came straight out of a jar. Dolmio does it better.\n",
            "  [26] Average place with average food at average prices. The very definition of three stars.\n",
            "  [27] The falafel wrap was crunchy, fresh, and the tahini sauce was incredible.\n",
            "  [28] The pulled pork sandwich was smoky, tender, and piled high. Absolute beast of a meal.\n",
            "  [29] Disappointing. The reviews online must be fake because the food was absolutely nothing special.\n",
            "  [30] The food was what it was. Not worth complaining about but not worth praising either.\n",
            "  [31] Found a hair in my soup. Lost my appetite for the rest of the meal.\n",
            "  [32] The charcuterie board had meats I'd never tried before and every single one was delicious.\n",
            "  [33] Lovely little café with homemade cakes that taste like your grandmother made them.\n",
            "  [34] The chocolate cake was so dry I needed an entire glass of water to get through one slice.\n",
            "  [35] Quality has gone downhill since they changed chefs. Used to be our favourite, now we're looking elsewhere.\n",
            "  [36] A reliable option. Never amazing but never terrible. You know exactly what you're going to get.\n",
            "  [37] They do a bottomless brunch that is genuinely good quality, not just cheap prosecco and cold eggs.\n",
            "  [38] The brisket had been smoked for 14 hours and you could taste every single one of them.\n",
            "  [39] The seafood platter was spectacular — fresh oysters, prawns, and the most incredible crab claws.\n",
            "  [40] The menu is small but everything on it is competent. Just not particularly inspired.\n",
            "  [41] They ran out of three things I tried to order. Maybe update the menu?\n",
            "  [42] The service was warm and attentive without being overbearing. They got the balance just right.\n",
            "  [43] This restaurant single-handedly got me into Indian food. The flavours are incredible.\n",
            "  [44] Brilliant place for a date night. Intimate, romantic, and the food is genuinely excellent.\n",
            "  [45] The lunch menu is brilliant value. The dinner menu is overpriced for what you get.\n",
            "  [46] Honestly the best Thai food outside of Thailand. The green curry had real depth of flavour.\n",
            "  [47] They refused to split the bill for our group of six. It's not 1995.\n",
            "  [48] The restaurant was freezing cold and they said the heating was broken. Ate in my coat.\n",
            "  [49] The sommelier recommended a wine I never would have picked and it was perfect with our meal.\n",
            "  [50] The dumplings were acceptable. Store-bought quality at restaurant prices, which is par for the course.\n",
            "  [51] Asked for my steak medium rare and got a piece of charcoal. Sent it back and the second attempt was no better.\n",
            "  [52] We were rushed through our meal because they wanted the table back. Never felt so unwelcome.\n",
            "  [53] The calamari was rubbery and the batter was soggy. Deep-frying is not that hard.\n",
            "  [54] We asked for the bill three times before anyone brought it. Then it had errors on it.\n",
            "  [55] This little gem is the best-kept secret in town. The pasta is handmade daily and you can taste the difference.\n",
            "  [56] The paella was loaded with seafood and the rice had that perfect socarrat crust on the bottom.\n",
            "  [57] The regular menu is solid but the specials are always disappointing. Stick to the classics.\n",
            "  [58] We come here every Sunday and it has become our family tradition. The roast is unbeatable.\n",
            "  [59] Nothing exciting on the menu but nothing offensive either. Safe choices all round.\n",
            "  [60] Took my mum here for her birthday and she loved it. The dessert menu is outstanding.\n",
            "  [61] Superb Korean BBQ. The banchan alone would be worth the visit.\n",
            "  [62] The garlic bread was burnt to a crisp. When I mentioned it they said 'that's how we make it'.\n",
            "  [63] The wine list was overpriced — the cheapest bottle was £35 and it tasted like vinegar.\n",
            "  [64] The bread basket cost £5 extra and it was three slices of supermarket bread. Insulting.\n",
            "  [65] Excellent location and nice outdoor seating but the food doesn't match the setting.\n",
            "  [66] What a find! Tucked away on a side street but absolutely world-class ramen.\n",
            "  [67] Standard curry house. Decent naan, acceptable korma. Nothing to phone anyone about.\n",
            "  [68] My four-year-old declared it 'the best restaurant in the whole world' and honestly I agree.\n",
            "  [69] Went for a work lunch. It was food. We ate it. We went back to work.\n",
            "  [70] Incredible sushi! The fish was so fresh it practically melted in your mouth.\n",
            "  [71] We waited 20 minutes just to get menus. Then another 20 for someone to take our order.\n",
            "  [72] The fried chicken was greasy and the coating fell off in one piece. Disappointing.\n",
            "  [73] Perfectly cromulent restaurant. The food was adequate and the price was fair.\n",
            "  [74] Noisy, cramped, and the food was mediocre at best. Don't believe the hype.\n",
            "  [75] The online photos look nothing like the actual restaurant. False advertising at its finest.\n",
            "  [76] The bread and butter they bring to start is better than most of the actual menu items.\n",
            "  [77] The naan bread was soft and pillowy, straight from the tandoor. Incredible.\n",
            "  [78] The breakfast was substantial and reasonably priced. Not the kind of place you'd make a special trip for.\n",
            "  [79] The milkshake tasted like flavoured milk. No ice cream, no thickness, no point.\n",
            "  [80] The banana bread is so popular they sell out by 10am. Get there early.\n",
            "  [81] The pad thai was exactly like what I had in Bangkok. Authentic and delicious.\n",
            "  [82] We sat outside on the terrace and the whole experience was magical. Food, setting, everything.\n",
            "  [83] The tiramisu was dry and tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for days.\n",
            "  [84] Lovely atmosphere, great wine list, and the risotto was creamy perfection.\n",
            "  [85] It's the kind of place you forget you've been to until someone mentions it and you go 'oh yeah, that place'.\n",
            "  [86] Amazing cocktails, below-average food. Come for drinks, eat elsewhere.\n",
            "  [87] It's not cheap but it's the kind of meal you remember for years. Worth the splurge.\n",
            "  [88] Their breakfast burrito is the reason I get up on Saturday mornings.\n",
            "  [89] Best pizza I've ever had. The crust was perfectly crispy and the toppings were so fresh.\n",
            "  [90] Clean, efficient, unremarkable. It's a perfectly functional restaurant.\n",
            "  [91] They wouldn't honour their own voucher because of 'terms and conditions' nobody told us about.\n",
            "  [92] I've eaten here maybe five times and I couldn't tell you what I've had. It's that kind of forgettable.\n",
            "  [93] The tiramisu here is legendary and now I understand why. Absolutely divine.\n",
            "  [94] Waited 45 minutes for our food and when it arrived it was stone cold.\n",
            "  [95] It's a solid 3 out of 5. You won't be disappointed but you won't be wowed either.\n",
            "  [96] We took some clients here and it made us look very good. Professional, polished, impressive.\n",
            "  [97] I'm coeliac and they had an entire separate gluten-free menu. Not just one sad option.\n",
            "  [98] The cocktails were weak and tasted like they'd been pre-mixed hours ago.\n",
            "  [99] Neither delighted nor angered by this dining experience. It simply was.\n",
            "  [100] Great starters, terrible mains. Very inconsistent experience.\n",
            "  [101] The dessert was clearly bought in from a supermarket. I recognised the packaging in the bin outside.\n",
            "  [102] Booked online, got a confirmation, arrived and they had no record of our booking. Full restaurant.\n",
            "  [103] Functional. That's the word I'd use. It functions as a restaurant.\n",
            "  [104] It's fine for a quick bite. I wouldn't plan an evening around it.\n",
            "  [105] Love the location, love the vibe, but the food is just okay. Frustrating because it could be so much more.\n",
            "  [106] The wood-fired oven makes all the difference. You can taste the smokiness in every bite.\n",
            "  [107] The steak was mostly fat and gristle. For £35 I expected actual meat.\n",
            "  [108] The spaghetti bolognese tasted like school dinner food. I've had better from a tin.\n",
            "  [109] The portion sizes are a joke for the prices they charge. Left hungry and £80 lighter.\n",
            "  [110] We ordered every dessert on the menu. Not a single miss among them.\n",
            "  [111] The lasagne was okay. A bit heavy on the béchamel for my taste but otherwise fine.\n",
            "  [112] The nachos were stale tortilla chips with some cheese microwaved on top. £11.\n",
            "  [113] I'm from Naples and this is the closest I've found to real Neapolitan pizza outside Italy.\n",
            "  [114] I give it a solid 'meh'. Not actively bad, just not actively anything.\n",
            "  [115] Looked great on Instagram. Tasted like any other café. Style over substance but not offensively so.\n",
            "  [116] The starter was one of the best things I've eaten. The main was one of the worst. Baffling.\n",
            "  [117] I want to love this place because the staff are so nice, but the food is just not there yet.\n",
            "  [118] The risotto was crunchy. Risotto. Crunchy. Enough said.\n",
            "  [119] Absolutely fantastic. The duck confit was crispy on the outside and tender inside. Perfect.\n",
            "  [120] The lamb was tough and chewy. It clearly hadn't been cooked long enough.\n",
            "  [121] The burger was dry and flavourless. The bun was stale. The chips were soggy. Zero out of three.\n",
            "  [122] The food was amazing but the service was so bad it ruined the experience.\n",
            "  [123] The food arrived quickly and tasted as expected. No complaints but no praise either.\n",
            "  [124] The food was okay. The service was okay. Everything was just okay.\n",
            "  [125] The toilet was disgusting. If that's the state of the bathroom, I dread to think about the kitchen.\n",
            "  [126] The fried chicken here has a secret spice blend that I would genuinely pay money to know.\n",
            "  [127] An inoffensive dining experience. Everything was competent but soulless.\n",
            "  [128] The portions were fair, the taste was adequate, and the experience was entirely forgettable.\n",
            "  [129] The pasta was cooked properly and the sauce was fine. Nothing to write home about though.\n",
            "  [130] The table wobbled so badly my drink spilled. They put a folded napkin under the leg. Fine dining indeed.\n",
            "  [131] Reserved a table for 7pm, arrived on time, and still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.\n",
            "  [132] The pad thai was swimming in oil and tasted of nothing. A waste of £14.\n",
            "  [133] The eggs florentine were so good I ordered a second portion. No regrets.\n",
            "  [134] Perfect for a casual meal but don't come here expecting fine dining despite the prices.\n",
            "  [135] Neither impressed nor disappointed. It exists and it serves food and that's about all I can say.\n",
            "  [136] Every single side dish was as thoughtfully prepared as the main. That's how you know a place is serious.\n",
            "  [137] The soup was warming and filling. Not the best I've had but certainly not the worst.\n",
            "  [138] The chicken was raw in the middle. Absolutely unacceptable and potentially dangerous.\n",
            "  [139] The waiter spilled red wine on my white shirt and laughed about it.\n",
            "  [140] The sandwich was exactly what you'd expect. Ham, cheese, bread. Nothing more, nothing less.\n",
            "  [141] I found plastic in my salad. When I told the manager he just shrugged.\n",
            "  [142] The taco al pastor was authentic and packed with flavour. Best Mexican food in the city.\n",
            "  [143] Quick service, friendly staff, and the burger was juicy and flavourful. What more could you want?\n",
            "  [144] The place was filthy. Crumbs on the seats, sticky menus, and food stains on the tablecloth.\n",
            "  [145] Overpriced and underwhelming. Paid £60 for what was basically a ready meal on a fancy plate.\n",
            "  [146] The matcha latte was the best I've had in this country. Smooth and not too sweet.\n",
            "  [147] The pizza was great but the pasta was awful. Very hit and miss.\n",
            "  [148] It was fine. Nothing wrong with it but nothing that made me want to come back either.\n",
            "  [149] This place has completely ruined other Italian restaurants for me. Nothing else compares now.\n",
            "  [150] The scones with clotted cream and jam were perfect. A proper afternoon tea experience.\n",
            "  [151] The rice was cooked well and the curry was reasonable. I've had better and I've had worse.\n",
            "  [152] They charged us for items we didn't order and then made us feel like we were lying when we questioned it.\n",
            "  [153] We had the chef's special and it was a revelation. Trust the chef here — they know what they're doing.\n",
            "  [154] The bill included a mandatory tip despite the worst service I've ever experienced.\n",
            "  [155] The curry was bland and watery. No spice, no depth, no point in ordering it.\n",
            "  [156] The breakfast was lukewarm and clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.\n",
            "  [157] First visit was a 5/5, second visit was a 2/5. Going back once more to break the tie.\n",
            "  [158] The soup of the day tasted like hot water with some vegetables floating in it.\n",
            "  [159] Fresh, vibrant, flavourful — this salad bar has completely changed my lunch routine.\n",
            "  [160] The ramen broth tasted like it had been made from a stock cube. No depth whatsoever.\n",
            "  [161] The dim sum here is authentic and delicious. The har gow are the best I've had outside Hong Kong.\n",
            "  [162] What impressed me most was how every dish arrived at exactly the right temperature. Hot food hot, cold food cold.\n",
            "  [163] I'm obsessed with their avocado toast. I know it's basic but theirs is genuinely next level.\n",
            "  [164] The view from the rooftop terrace paired with the food made for an unforgettable evening.\n",
            "  [165] This tiny hole-in-the-wall serves the best dumplings you'll find anywhere. Don't let the exterior fool you.\n",
            "  [166] Brought a group of 12 for a work dinner and they handled it flawlessly.\n",
            "  [167] The mango sticky rice dessert transported me straight back to Chiang Mai. Absolute bliss.\n",
            "  [168] The chips were clearly frozen ones from a bag. At those prices I expect hand-cut.\n",
            "  [169] They added a 15% service charge automatically and the service was dreadful. Had to argue to get it removed.\n",
            "  [170] The wrap was filling and reasonably tasty. Would eat again if I was passing by.\n",
            "  [171] The omelette was fluffy and filled. Good portion size. Nothing special about the flavour though.\n",
            "  [172] The laksa was rich, spicy, and deeply satisfying. Proper comfort food done right.\n",
            "  [173] Food was good but they sat us next to a table of screaming children. Not the restaurant's fault, but still.\n",
            "  [174] It's a convenient spot with reasonable prices. The food is predictable in a neutral sort of way.\n",
            "  [175] Amazing vegan menu that doesn't feel like an afterthought. The mushroom wellington was outstanding.\n",
            "  [176] The croissants are flaky and buttery — clearly made by someone who cares about their craft.\n",
            "  [177] The gyoza were clearly microwaved. The bottom was soggy and the filling was nuclear hot in the middle.\n",
            "  [178] The coffee was standard. The cake was standard. The decor was standard. A very standard café.\n",
            "  [179] We brought our kids and they were so accommodating. The children's menu actually has proper food on it.\n",
            "  [180] They remembered our names from our last visit three months ago. That personal touch means everything.\n",
            "  [181] We made a booking for a birthday and asked for a cake. They forgot the cake.\n",
            "  [182] The granola bowl was fresh, crunchy, and not drowning in sugar like most places. Properly healthy.\n",
            "  [183] They don't take reservations and we queued for an hour. The food was not worth the wait.\n",
            "  [184] I specifically asked for dairy-free and the sauce clearly had cream in it. I was ill afterwards.\n",
            "  [185] The moules frites were perfectly cooked — plump mussels in a white wine broth with crispy fries.\n",
            "  [186] The air conditioning was broken in the middle of summer. We were literally sweating onto our food.\n",
            "  [187] I'm a regular and have never had a bad meal here. The consistency is remarkable.\n",
            "  [188] We've tried dozens of sushi restaurants and keep coming back to this one. It's simply the best.\n",
            "  [189] Went for a quick lunch and stayed for three hours. The food just kept getting better.\n",
            "  [190] My gluten-free meal arrived on a regular bun. When I pointed it out they just swapped the bun. Cross-contamination much?\n",
            "  [191] The kids' menu was just frozen nuggets and chips. Put some effort in.\n",
            "  [192] Came here because it was close to the office. Would come again for the same reason but not otherwise.\n",
            "  [193] Portions are generous and the prices are very fair for the quality you get.\n",
            "  [194] The ceviche was bright, zingy, and perfectly fresh. Best starter I've had in ages.\n",
            "  [195] Beautiful decor and lovely atmosphere, but the food was disappointing for the price.\n",
            "  [196] I love that they source everything locally. You can taste the quality of the ingredients.\n",
            "  [197] My steak arrived still sizzling and it was cooked exactly how I asked for it. Medium rare perfection.\n",
            "  [198] My vegetarian friend said this was the first time she felt like a restaurant actually catered for her.\n",
            "  [199] The french onion soup had a thick layer of melted gruyère and the broth was deeply savoury. Perfection.\n",
            "  [200] The desserts were incredible but we had to wait over an hour for them. Mixed feelings.\n",
            "  [201] Great concept, poor execution. The idea behind the menu is creative but the cooking lets it down.\n",
            "  [202] They gave us a complimentary amuse-bouche that was better than most restaurants' main courses.\n",
            "  [203] Perfectly acceptable for a Tuesday night dinner when you can't be bothered to cook.\n",
            "  [204] Loved the food, hated the noise level. Would be perfect if it wasn't so loud.\n",
            "  [205] I ordered the fish and chips on a whim and it was genuinely the best I've ever had.\n",
            "  [206] A three-star restaurant in every possible sense of the word.\n",
            "  [207] The truffle pasta was aromatic and indulgent. A real treat for a special occasion.\n",
            "  [208] Service was the best I've ever experienced but the food was just average.\n",
            "  [209] Average pizza. Not bad, not great. Does the job if you're nearby and hungry.\n",
            "  [210] The butter chicken was rich and creamy without being heavy. Perfectly spiced.\n",
            "  [211] Clean restaurant, polite staff, bland food. The trifecta of mediocrity.\n",
            "  [212] The chicken was seasoned fine and cooked through. A safe choice for a safe restaurant.\n",
            "  [213] We came here for our anniversary and it did not disappoint. The steak was cooked to perfection.\n",
            "  [214] The pizza was round, had toppings, and was warm. That's about the extent of my review.\n",
            "  [215] A truly special place. The kind of restaurant that reminds you why eating out is worth it.\n",
            "  [216] The espresso was bitter and burnt. For a place that calls itself a café, they can't make coffee.\n",
            "  [217] The music was so loud we had to shout to have a conversation. Not what you want at a nice restaurant.\n",
            "  [218] The cheese board was a work of art. Beautiful selection with all the right accompaniments.\n",
            "  [219] They got our order wrong twice and didn't even apologise. Terrible service.\n",
            "  [220] The chef clearly has talent but the portions are insultingly small for the price.\n",
            "  [221] Pretty standard pub food. The fish and chips were alright. Wouldn't go out of my way for it.\n",
            "  [222] Our food arrived at completely different times. I'd finished before my partner's dish even appeared.\n",
            "  [223] Good for what it is. It's a chain restaurant and it tastes like a chain restaurant.\n",
            "  [224] The wagyu beef was worth every penny. Melt-in-your-mouth doesn't begin to describe it.\n",
            "  [225] The avocado on the toast was brown and clearly not fresh. Charged £12 for it anyway.\n",
            "  [226] Brilliant brunch spot on weekdays. Avoid weekends — the wait is unbearable and they rush you.\n",
            "  [227] They seated us right next to the kitchen door. Every time it swung open we got a blast of heat and noise.\n",
            "  [228] The sushi rice was warm and mushy. A fundamental failure for a sushi restaurant.\n",
            "  [229] We drove an hour to get here based on a friend's recommendation and it was absolutely worth the trip.\n",
            "  [230] They catered our wedding and every single guest raved about the food.\n",
            "  [231] The sourdough bread they bring to the table before the meal is better than most restaurants' main courses.\n",
            "  [232] Five stars. The lamb shank fell off the bone and the red wine reduction was heavenly.\n",
            "  [233] We've been coming here every Friday for three years. Consistently excellent food and service.\n",
            "  [234] The fish smelled off. I didn't eat it and I'm glad I didn't. My partner who ate theirs was ill the next day.\n",
            "  [235] Our server was on their phone for most of our visit. Had to flag someone else down to order.\n",
            "  [236] We ordered the sharing platter for two and it could have fed four. Amazing value.\n",
            "  [237] We could hear the staff arguing in the kitchen throughout our meal. Very uncomfortable.\n",
            "  [238] The first time we came it was fantastic. This time it was mediocre. Not sure what happened.\n",
            "  [239] The takeaway is great but eating in is a letdown. The ambience does nothing for the food.\n",
            "  [240] They overbooked and tried to seat us at a tiny table next to the toilets. We left.\n",
            "  [241] I've eaten at Michelin-starred restaurants that weren't as good as this neighbourhood bistro.\n",
            "  [242] A perfectly adequate restaurant. Not somewhere I'd recommend but not somewhere I'd avoid.\n",
            "  [243] The pho was aromatic and warming — exactly what I needed on a cold evening.\n",
            "  [244] Fast, fresh, affordable. This place is my go-to for a weekday lunch.\n",
            "  [245] My partner is vegan and I eat everything — we both had an incredible meal here. That's hard to find.\n",
            "  [246] The lobster bisque was silky smooth and packed with flavour. I wanted to lick the bowl.\n",
            "  [247] Middle of the road. The burger was edible, the fries were warm, the service was acceptable.\n",
            "  [248] The brunch here is unreal. Eggs benedict with hollandaise that actually tastes homemade.\n",
            "  [249] Everything we ordered was beautifully presented. You eat with your eyes first and this place knows it.\n",
            "  [250] We pointed out a fly in the restaurant and were told 'it's summer, what do you expect?'.\n"
